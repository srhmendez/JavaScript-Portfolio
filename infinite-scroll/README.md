# Unsplash Infinite Scroll Photo Gallery

[View Project](https://affectionate-mahavira-8a90d5.netlify.app)

In this project, I fetched data from the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation) to generate an Array of randomly selected images. I used WW3 Schools animated SVG loaders to show the user that the data is coming in soon upon the initial load of the page. I used JavaScript to create the illusion of an image gallery with an endless scrolling feature.

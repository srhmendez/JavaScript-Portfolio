# Picture In Picture Project

[View Project]()

The idea of this project is to create a button that will allow you to start the picture in picture feature once you select a screen to share upon loading the page.  Once the page is loaded and the desired screen is selected, you will be able to view a video on top of any window you have open. The idea is that you would be able to watch a video while working, browsing, or multitasking on another window in the background. For this project am using the [Screen Capture API documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Capture_API/Using_Screen_Capture).

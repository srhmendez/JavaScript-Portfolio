# Quote Generator

[View Project](https://compassionate-leavitt-ee22c7.netlify.app/)

In this project, I used the [forismatic Quote Generator API](https://forismatic.com/en/api/) to randomly generate quotes. I used JavaScript to dynamically
control the DOM element that housed the API data. I used a loading bar with CSS animations to indicated when a quote is being loaded. I also used two buttons
in the design. One to tweet the quote currently displayed to the div and the other to generate a new quote.

# Quote Generator

[View Project]()

In this project, I used the [Joke API](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) to randomly generate jokes that will then be read outloud using a [Text To Speach API](http://www.voicerss.org/api/). I used JavaScript to dynamically control the DOM element that housed the API data. I used a GIF as the background to the webpage from giphy (author is credited in metadata of GIF file).
